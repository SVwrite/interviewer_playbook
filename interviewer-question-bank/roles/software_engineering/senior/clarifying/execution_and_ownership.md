## When to ask
Ask these questions when the candidate uses collective language ("we built", "the team did")
and it is unclear what they personally owned.

This is critical when:
- evaluating Senior vs strong Mid candidates
- assessing responsibility beyond implementation
- determining production accountability

## Clarifying Questions
- What parts did you personally own?
- What were you accountable for if this failed?
- Where did this go wrong the first time?
- What happened after this went to production?
- Who depended on your work?

## What you are listening for
You are listening for clarity around:
- personal responsibility boundaries
- ownership through failure, not just success
- involvement after deployment

Acceptable senior-level answers typically include:
- clear separation of personal vs team ownership
- mention of post-production monitoring or fixes
- willingness to discuss things that went wrong

## Direction after answers
Clear end-to-end ownership supports Senior.
Partial ownership with heavy guidance suggests Mid.
Task-level execution without production responsibility strongly indicates Mid.
