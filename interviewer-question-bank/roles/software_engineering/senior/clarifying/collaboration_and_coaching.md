## When to ask
Ask these questions when the candidate claims mentoring or collaboration experience
but has not yet given concrete examples.

This is especially important because coaching is a core Senior signal in your framework.

## Clarifying Questions
- How did you help others understand this problem?
- How do you give feedback when someone disagrees with you?
- Can you give a concrete example of mentoring someone?
- How do you handle repeated mistakes from the same person?
- How do you balance delivery speed with helping others grow?

## What you are listening for
You are listening for evidence that the candidate:
- improves how others think, not just what they deliver
- communicates feedback constructively
- invests time in others even under pressure

Acceptable senior-level answers usually include:
- a specific person or situation
- explanation of how guidance changed behavior over time
- emphasis on learning, not authority

## Direction after answers
Clear, concrete coaching examples strongly support Senior.
Passive or incidental help suggests borderline Senior.
No real people impact suggests Mid.
