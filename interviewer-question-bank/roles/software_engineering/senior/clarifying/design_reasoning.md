## When to ask
Ask these questions when the candidate has described a system or feature,
but their explanation focuses mostly on what was built rather than why it was built that way.

This is especially useful when:
- the answer sounds polished but shallow
- decisions sound inherited rather than reasoned
- trade-offs are implied but not stated

Do not ask these if the candidate already explains trade-offs unprompted.

## Clarifying Questions
- What alternatives did you seriously consider?
- Why did you reject the other options?
- What assumptions did this design rely on?
- What part of the design worried you the most?
- What would you change if you were to build this again today?

## What you are listening for
You are listening for evidence that the candidate:
- actively reasoned about multiple options
- understood constraints such as time, scale, team skill, or legacy systems
- can articulate consequences of choices, not just outcomes

Acceptable senior-level answers often include:
- acknowledgment that no option was perfect
- explanation of trade-offs in plain language
- awareness of second-order effects

## Direction after answers
If the candidate clearly explains trade-offs and constraints, this supports a Senior decision.
If reasoning is vague but improving with prompts, this may still be borderline Senior.
If the candidate cannot explain why decisions were made, this strongly suggests a Mid-level ceiling.
