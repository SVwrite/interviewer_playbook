## When to ask
Ask these questions when decisions sound overly clean, idealized, or retrospective.
They are useful when you suspect hindsight bias or lack of risk awareness.

## Clarifying Questions
- What risks did you actively accept in this decision?
- What was the blast radius if this failed?
- How did you mitigate the biggest risk?
- What signals told you things were going wrong?
- What would you do differently next time?

## What you are listening for
You are listening for:
- explicit acknowledgment of risk
- conscious trade-off between speed, safety, and quality
- awareness of failure modes and mitigation strategies

Acceptable senior-level answers often include:
- discussion of uncertainty at the time of decision
- clear reasoning about why risks were acceptable
- learning extracted from failure or near-failure

## Direction after answers
Risk-aware reasoning supports Senior.
Naive optimism suggests borderline Senior.
Inability to articulate risk strongly indicates Mid.
