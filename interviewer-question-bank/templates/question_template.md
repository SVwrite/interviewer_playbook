## Question
Tell me about a system or feature where you were involved in design decisions.
What trade-offs did you make, and why?

## What this tests
- Ability to reason about alternatives
- Awareness of constraints (scale, time, team)

## Acceptable answers
- Mentions rejected options
- Explains consequences of choices
- Acknowledges imperfect decisions

## Red flags
- No trade-offs discussed
- Only implementation details
- “We just followed best practices”
